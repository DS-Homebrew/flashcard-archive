This is a loader for DEMON-based devices (commonly known as timebombed carts.)
This will directly launch TTMenu.dat, and is intended to be used with YSMenu.

DO NOT under any circumstance combine this with official TTMenu. Your flashcart will be BRICKED.

The only change in this file is that the boot target was changed from `BOOT.NDS` to `TTMenu.dat`.
