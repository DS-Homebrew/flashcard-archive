Beup Live 0.7 Release Notes:

It seems to be that Microsoft took down MSNP9 Protocol.
This means that Beup Live doesn't work anymore, since it uses MSNP9.
I downgraded Beup Live to MSNP8 (which still works) for the people who still wants to use Beup Live.
The only bad side is that there is no avatar support in MSNP8.

Changelog:
- Fixed: You can login again with Beup Live.
(No more "Connection to notification server has died." error)
- Changed from MSNP9 to MSNP8.

Have fun chatting!
